# MTG Format Price Data Analysis

This project is intended to analysze the price of a deck in the various popular formats of Magic: The Gathering.  Metagame decklists are sourced from MTGGoldfish.com, and the card prices are collected and cleaned from the Scryfall.com API.

Each format's decklists are already cleaned and storeed in the csv files used for the price calculation files, but the original text files and the Decklist Cleaning notebook are included here for reference and reusability.

The final output at the moment is a csv for each analyzed format inclding deck names and prices for each relevant platform.  Once I have each format analyzed, these will eventually be combined into one larger dataset for visualization.
