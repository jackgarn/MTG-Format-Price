# MTG Format Price Data Analysis

This project is intended to analysze the price of a deck in the various popular formats of Magic: The Gathering.  Metagame decklists are sourced from MTGGoldfish.com, and the card prices and other individual card information are collected and cleaned from the Scryfall.com API.

Each format's decklists are already cleaned and stored in the csv files used for the price calculation files, but the original text files and the Decklist Cleaning notebook are included here for reference and reusability.

I initially was processing each format individually, but reworked things to all work at once and to be able to have fomrats added or removed easily.  All visualizations found in the Data Viz Directory were produced through Tableau.
